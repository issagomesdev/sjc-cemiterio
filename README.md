<h2 id="about">üìå About</h2>

<p>
SJC Cemit√©rios is a cemetery management platform developed to support municipalities in the organization and control of public cemeteries, while also offering compatibility with private cemeteries. The system enables complete and efficient management of burial spaces, records, and funeral processes, featuring hierarchical registration (cemeteries, sectors, blocks, plots, ossuaries, and drawers), as well as death records, transfers, and report generation.
</p>

<p>
In addition to user and permission administration, the platform includes advanced features such as action auditing, dynamic filtering, data export, and an interactive map that facilitates grave location. It was built with a focus on usability, organization, and data reliability, promoting agility and transparency in cemetery administration.
